Here is stored my analysis scripts.
Real_data foulder includes analysis of real data and it's visualization script.  F+O+C+V_M0.R for M0 vs M0 experiment and F+O+C+V_M1.R foor M0 vs M1 experiment.
In simulation foulder there are camera_lile_simulation.R for simulation with no diffexpression and like_test_with_corr_only_in_path.R for simulation 
with true differential expression. 
Other scripts are supplementary, nessesary for main scripts work
